BUSINESS CONTEXT:
Business: {business_description}
Target Audience: {target_audience}
Screen Sizes Provided: {', '.join(screen_sizes)}

YOUR MISSION: Evaluate the VISUAL design quality by analyzing the provided screenshots.

EVALUATION CRITERIA (Score each 0-10):

1. **INSTANT VISUAL CLARITY (5-Second Test)** [0-10]
   Look at the screenshots and ask:
   - Within 5 seconds of viewing, is the business purpose crystal clear?
   - Is the main headline/value proposition visible and readable?
   - Is the primary call-to-action obvious and prominent?
   - Can you tell what this business does WITHOUT reading everything?
   - Does visual hierarchy guide the eye to key information?
   
   Visual indicators:
   ✓ Large, clear headline above the fold
   ✓ Obvious CTA button (contrasting color, prominent placement)
   ✓ Clean layout without clutter
   ✓ Clear visual hierarchy (size, contrast, spacing)
   
   Scoring:
   - 9-10: Instant understanding, perfect clarity
   - 7-8: Clear with minor improvements possible
   - 5-6: Requires effort to understand
   - 3-4: Confusing, unclear purpose
   - 0-2: Completely unclear

2. **VISUAL UNIQUENESS (Template Detection)** [0-10]
   Analyze the visual design:
   - Does this look like a generic Bootstrap/WordPress template?
   - Are colors distinctive or generic (blue/grey/white only)?
   - Is the layout unique or cookie-cutter?
   - Do visual elements show custom design work?
   - Would you recognize this brand if you saw it again?
   
   Red Flags (reduce score):
   ❌ Generic stock photos (overused business imagery)
   ❌ Default template colors (Bootstrap blue, grey, white only)
   ❌ Standard navbar + hero + 3-column features layout
   ❌ Generic icons without customization
   ❌ Lorem ipsum or placeholder content visible
   
   Green Flags (increase score):
   ✓ Custom color palette (distinctive brand colors)
   ✓ Unique layout or asymmetric design
   ✓ Custom illustrations or real photography
   ✓ Consistent brand identity across screens
   ✓ Distinctive typography choices
   
   Scoring:
   - 9-10: Highly unique, memorable visual identity
   - 7-8: Some unique elements, professional execution
   - 5-6: Mix of unique and generic elements
   - 3-4: Mostly template with minor changes
   - 0-2: Pure template, zero visual uniqueness

3. **EMOTIONAL VISUAL DESIGN** [0-10]
   Evaluate the emotional impact:
   - Does the visual design create trust and professionalism?
   - Are there humanizing elements (testimonials, real photos, personal story)?
   - Does color psychology align with business type?
   - Is whitespace used effectively (not cramped or overwhelming)?
   - Do visual elements evoke appropriate emotions?
   
   Trust indicators:
   ✓ Professional photography (not obviously stock)
   ✓ Visible testimonials or social proof
   ✓ Clean, organized layout
   ✓ Consistent design quality
   ✓ Appropriate color mood (warm for family business, bold for tech, etc.)
   
   Scoring:
   - 9-10: Strong emotional connection, builds immediate trust
   - 7-8: Good professional feel with personality
   - 5-6: Neutral, neither connecting nor disconnecting
   - 3-4: Cold, impersonal, or low-trust design
   - 0-2: Actively unprofessional or suspicious

4. **VALUE PROPOSITION VISIBILITY** [0-10]
   Assess how clearly value is communicated visually:
   - Is the unique value proposition prominently displayed?
   - Are key benefits visible without scrolling? (above the fold)
   - Is there visual emphasis on differentiation?
   - Are there visual proof points (numbers, results, guarantees)?
   - Is the call-to-action compelling and visible?
   
   Visual assessment:
   ✓ Value prop in large text near top
   ✓ Visual hierarchy emphasizes benefits
   ✓ Numbers/statistics displayed prominently
   ✓ CTA button stands out with size and color
   ✓ Benefit icons or graphics reinforce messaging
   
   Scoring:
   - 9-10: Value proposition impossible to miss
   - 7-8: Clear value with good visual emphasis
   - 5-6: Value present but not visually emphasized
   - 3-4: Unclear or buried value proposition
   - 0-2: No visible value proposition

RESPONSIVE DESIGN ASSESSMENT:
If multiple screen sizes provided, also evaluate:
- Does the design work well on all screen sizes?
- Is text readable on mobile?
- Are touch targets appropriately sized?
- Does layout adapt gracefully?
(This affects all scores if responsive design fails)

MINIMUM PASSING SCORE: 35/40 (87.5%)

BE HONEST AND CRITICAL based on what you SEE in the screenshots.
Generic template designs should score 20-28/40.
Professional unique designs should score 36-40/40.
